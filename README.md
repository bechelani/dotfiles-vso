# bechelani does dotfiles - forked from jldeen's repo

### WSL Configuration
Run the following to configure WSL from scratch...
```
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bechelani/dotfiles/wsl/configure.sh)"
```

### Notes
Your dotfiles are how you personalize your system. These are mine.

## topical

Everything's built around topic areas. If you're adding a new area to your
forked dotfiles — say, "Java" — you can simply add a `java` directory and put
files in there. Anything with an extension of `.zsh` will get automatically
included into your shell. Anything with an extension of `.symlink` will get
symlinked without extension into `$HOME` when you run `script/bootstrap`.

## what's inside

A lot of stuff. Seriously, a lot of stuff. Check them out in the file browser
above and see what components may mesh up with you.
[Fork holman's](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles/fork) or [Fork mine](htps://github.com/jldeen/dotfiles/fork), remove what you don't
use, and build on what you do use.

## components

There's a few special files in the hierarchy.

- **bin/**: Anything in `bin/` will get added to your `$PATH` and be made
  available everywhere.
- **Brewfile**: This is a list of applications for [Homebrew Cask](https://caskroom.github.io) to install: things like Chrome and 1Password and Adium and stuff. Might want to edit this file before running any initial setup.
- **topic/\*.zsh**: Any files ending in `.zsh` get loaded into your
  environment.
- **topic/path.zsh**: Any file named `path.zsh` is loaded first and is
  expected to setup `$PATH` or similar.
- **topic/completion.zsh**: Any file named `completion.zsh` is loaded
  last and is expected to setup autocomplete.
- **topic/install.sh**: Any file named `install.sh` is executed when you run `script/install`. To avoid being loaded automatically, its extension is `.sh`, not `.zsh`.
- **topic/\*.symlink**: Any file ending in `*.symlink` gets symlinked into
  your `$HOME`. This is so you can keep all of those versioned in your dotfiles
  but still keep those autoloaded files in your home directory. These get
  symlinked in when you run `script/bootstrap`.

## install
There are two branches here: WSL and MacOS (still in development).

Run this:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/jldeen/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
script/bootstrap
```

This will symlink the appropriate files in `.dotfiles` to your home directory.
Everything is configured and tweaked within `~/.dotfiles`.

The main file you'll want to change right off the bat is `zsh/zshrc.symlink`,
which sets up a few paths that'll be different on your particular machine. You also might want to configure `.tmux.conf` since I run a few scripts in the status bar.

`dot` is a simple script that installs some dependencies, sets sane macOS
defaults, and so on. Tweak this script, and occasionally run `dot` from
time to time to keep your environment fresh and up-to-date. You can find
this script in `bin/`.

## bugs

I want this to work for everyone; that means when you clone it down it should
work for you even though you may not have `rbenv` installed, for example. That
said, I do use this as *my* dotfiles, so there's a good chance I may break
something if I forget to make a check for a dependency.

If you're brand-new to the project and run into any blockers, please
[open an issue](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles/issues) on this repository
and I'd love to get it fixed for you!

## thanks

I forked [Ryan Bates](http://github.com/ryanb)' excellent
[dotfiles](http://github.com/ryanb/dotfiles) for a couple years before the
weight of my changes and tweaks inspired me to finally roll my own. But Ryan's
dotfiles were an easy way to get into bash customization, and then to jump ship
to zsh a bit later. A decent amount of the code in these dotfiles stem or are
inspired from Ryan's original project.

Oh My Zsh Distribution Notes
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What you are looking at now is Oh My Zsh's repackaging of zsh-history-substring-search 
as an OMZ module inside the Oh My Zsh distribution.

The upstream repo, zsh-users/zsh-history-substring-search, can be found on GitHub at 
https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-history-substring-search.

This downstream copy was last updated from the following upstream commit:

  SHA:          
  Commit date:  

Everything above this section is a copy of the original upstream's README, so things
may differ slightly when you're using this inside OMZ. In particular, you do not
need to set up key bindings for the up and down arrows yourself in `~/.zshrc`; the OMZ 
plugin does that for you. You may still want to set up additional emacs- or vi-specific
bindings as mentioned above.
